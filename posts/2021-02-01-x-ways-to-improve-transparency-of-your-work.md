# X ways to improve transparency of your work

Problem: you're doing something, but no one knows what. You're being asked on standup or pinged.

Traditional, naive ways:

* Standup
* Ticket updates
* Private message: "How it's going with PR-xxx?"

Why they're not cool?

* distracting
* ineffective

New cool ways:

* `--verbose`
* async standup
* frequent, meaningful elaborate commit messages
* live google doc
* discord voice channles, screen sharing
* snaps
* pairing, intermittent pairing
* cut the project into small storiess, deliver daily

Each of these has nice side effects:
