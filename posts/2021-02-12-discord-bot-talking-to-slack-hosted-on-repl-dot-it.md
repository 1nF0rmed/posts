# Discord-to-Slack bot hosted on repl.it

## The story

So we started using Discord alongside Slack recently. The selling point were the voice channels. There's no calling each other. You join a voice channel. When someone else joins, then you chat. It allowed us to communicate by voice in most _async_ way possible. And we like to stay _async_. 

<!-- link tweet -->
<!-- no migration -->

```ruby
require "discordrb"
require "httparty"

def notify(message)
  HTTParty.post(
    "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx/xxxx/xxxxx",
    body: JSON.dump({ text: message }),
    headers: { "Content-Type" => "application/json" }
  )
end

bot = Discordrb::Bot.new(token: "xxxx.xxx.xxxx")

bot.voice_state_update do |event|
  case 
  when event.channel.nil?
    notify "‚úÇÔ∏è #{event.user.name} disconnected"
  when event.old_channel.nil?
    notify "üëã #{event.user.name} connected to #{event.channel.name}"
  when event.channel.name != event.old_channel.name
    notify "üîÄ #{event.user.name} switched to #{event.channel.name}"
  end
end

at_exit { bot.stop }
bot.run
```
