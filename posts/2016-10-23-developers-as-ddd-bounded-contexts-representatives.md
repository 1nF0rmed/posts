In this blogpost I'd like to highlight some of such contexts.

The thing I'd like you to focus on is that the different types of developers - they all use different vocabulary when they play different roles. It's worth noting it just for the purpose of a successful communication but also to learn that it's the main point of DDD - find the domain language.
