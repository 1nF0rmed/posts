Recently, I've been preparing to my webinar about introducing DDD to existing projects/teams.

One DDD part which is not always easy to explain is actually the main strategic pattern - bounded contexts. For the webinar purpose I came up with the idea of showing that in our programming teams we also have bounded contexts. What's better, most of us, represent different bounded contexts.

In this blogpost I'd like to highlight some of such contexts.

The thing I'd like you to focus on is that the different types of developers - they all use different vocabulary when they play different roles. It's worth noting it just for the purpose of a successful communication but also to learn that it's the main point of DDD - find the domain language.

## Performance oriented developer

- "we should have written it in SQL"
- "there's nothing faster than reading from a file"
- loves performance benchmarks
- favourite words: cache, traffic, rpm (requests per minute)

## Framework-man

- loves having many buzzwords in the resume
- believes in the current The Framework Way
- honours only developers who created frameworks
- silently dreams about writing own framework
- always up to date with the new framework of the week
- great for writing prototypes

## TDDer

- can't sleep if someone wrote production code without tests first
- when reviews code of others, starts with tests
- with all new features thinks "how am I going to test it?"
- great at refactoring critical pieces of code
- makes sure about test coverage
- excited about mutation testing

## Sad FP programmer

- super intelligent
- can't accept that some people see the world as mutable
- modeling business means writing math equations
- is sad, because can't write code in the purest FP language
- great at dealing with concurrency


## Over-excited agiler

- open-space fan
- loves when people talk to each other
- loves post-it notes on the wall
- loves moving post-it notes between columns
