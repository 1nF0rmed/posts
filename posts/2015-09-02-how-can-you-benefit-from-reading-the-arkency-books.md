As a Ruby/Rails developer, you have so many books to learn from. The choice is sometimes too big which can lead to choice paralysis. 

In this blogpost I'd like to focus on the different aspects of your developer life. There are so many skills to improve. The Rails skills are the obvious ones. But there's much more than that. Working in a team, safe refactoring, well-structured frontend applications, communicating with other people, even blogging.

I'd like to explain how we're helping with improving those skills with our Arkency books.

# Rails applications

Big chances are that you're working on Rails applications. Some of them are probably the ones, which are not so pretty. You'd like to improve them (Scout Rule anyone?) but it's not clear how to do it. Also, it's a risk - what if you break anything?
Another typical problem is the tests taking ages to run (and often fail for random reasons).

This is exactly why we came up with the book called: "Fearless Refactoring: Rails Controllers".

Thanks to this book, you'll be able to improve your Rails codebase with more confidence. You will become fluent with new abstractions, like service objects, repositories, adapters.
Your tests will run faster, saving you and your team a lot of time (and money!).

The book was released as 1.0 in December 2014. The techniques which are included are not related to any specific Rails version - they can be applied to all Rails apps. They will work with Rails 2, Rails 3, Rails 4 and Rails 5 versions just fine.
