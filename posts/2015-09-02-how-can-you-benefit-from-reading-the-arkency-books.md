As a Ruby/Rails developer, you have so many books to learn from. The choice is sometimes too big which can lead to choice paralysis. 

In this blogpost I'd like to focus on the different aspects of your developer life. There are so many skills to improve. The Rails skills are the obvious ones. But there's much more than that. Working in a team, safe refactoring, well-structured frontend applications, communicating with other people, even blogging.

I'd like to explain how we're helping with improving those skills with our Arkency books.

# Rails applications

Big chances are that you're working on Rails applications. Some of them are probably the ones, which are not so pretty. You'd like to improve them (Scout Rule anyone?) but it's not clear how to do it. Also, it's a risk - what if you break anything?
Another typical problem is the tests taking ages to run (and often fail for random reasons).

This is exactly why we came up with the book called: "Fearless Refactoring: Rails Controllers".

Thanks to this book, you'll be able to improve your Rails codebase with more confidence. You will become fluent with new abstractions, like service objects, repositories, adapters.
Your tests will run faster, saving you and your team a lot of time (and money!).

Thanks to this book, you will know where all kinds of Rails code belong to. You will get more conventions to use, even in bigger Rails apps.

The book was released as 1.0 in December 2014. The techniques which are included are not related to any specific Rails version - they can be applied to all Rails apps. They will work with Rails 2, Rails 3, Rails 4 and Rails 5 versions just fine.

# JavaScript frontends for Rails apps

As Rails developers, we were happy writing just Ruby code, for many years. Nowadays, just Ruby is not enough. We need to build rich user interfaces, which are possible only in JavaScript.

A big part of the Ruby community went with CoffeeScript, while some stayed with JavaScript.

The community was also split between many different frameworks. Some of us went with Angular, some went with jQuery, some went with Ember. 
React.js is the new approach to building JavaScript components. Backed by Facebook, it's trending now, for good reasons.

After many (sometimes unsuccessful) journeys with other frameworks, we felt in love with React.js. As Arkency, we were probably one of the first companies to adopt React.js fully (thanks Marcin!). Very quickly, all the Arkency developers noticed the clean structure which React provides and it was adopted in almost all of our projects.

We learnt a lot about how to combine React.js with a typical Rails application. As a result, we shared the experiences in the "Rails meets React.js" book. 

The book will teach you:

* How to install and configure React.js in your Rails project.
* Working with dynamic React based forms.
* How to transform your view to React-managed components.
* What you can use React.js for in your projects and how.
* Detailed knowledge about how to use it and best practices to work with React.js, with examples.
* How to test React components.
* You will also get Ruby and Coffeescript code for the examples.
* And it begins with a tutorial so that you start with practical skills.
