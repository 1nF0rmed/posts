## YAML

* you can just throw whatever at it and have it serialized
* self-contained schema

```
example payload
```

## JSON

* you need schema definition for anything beyond json types
* dry

## JSONB

* you can query


## Marshal

* almost like yaml - you can throw anything ruby at it
* but unreadable
* and dangerous?

## Protobuf
