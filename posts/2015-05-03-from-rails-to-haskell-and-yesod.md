I learnt Ruby by using Rails. I remember that over 10 years ago, I was typing `has_many :items` without understanding that `has_many` is a class method. I didn't event know at that time, that a Ruby class is an object.

I'm trying to apply the same pattern of learning to Haskell and other languages. I don't know Haskell. I couldn't type a hello world application in Haskell without. 

This blog post is about my first steps in learning Yesod (the Rails equivalent for Haskell) and my thoughts about it.

I think it was about 17 years ago (yes, I'm that old) when I first learnt about the Functional Programming concepts and some foundations of type systems. FP is not totally foreign to me. 17 years ago I was told by some super smart people from the University of Wroclaw that FP would be the future "soon". They may have been a bit optimistic in this prediction, however the trends are indeed showing that FP is becoming mainstream.

**The skills of selling FP**

As developers we don't feel comfortable with the concept of selling. We don't trust when someone is trying to sell something to us. But sometimes it's different. 
If you're reading this, the chances are that you're a Ruby developer. 

Would you be a Ruby developer if DHH didn't have his selling skills over 10 years ago?
