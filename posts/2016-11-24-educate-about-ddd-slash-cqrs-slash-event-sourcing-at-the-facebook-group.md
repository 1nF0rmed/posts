There's more and more places where people interested in DDD can learn more. One of those places is the [DDD/CQRS google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dddcqrs), from which I learnt a lot!


<!-- more -->

I was wondering if a more light-weight place to learn about DDD would make sense and as part of an experiment, I've started a Facebook group. I know that not all people use Facebook, but I know several thriving programming communities on Facebook, so why not?

Feel free [to join the new Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1232045823501220/) and learn more. The place is meant to be technology-agnostic. Ruby, Java, .Net, JavaScript, you name it. What's great is that the DDD/CQRS/Event Sourcing patterns look almost the same in all the languages. They all make sense. Why not learn from other communities too?

Feel free to just lurk but I also encourage you to post DDD-related blogposts and all kind of questions you may have! Even if you're a total newbie, it's OK to ask questions.

See you on the [DDD CQRS Event Sourcing Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1232045823501220/) :)
