# N simple ways to make remote work less lonely

I joined Arkency, a remote-first company, 4+ years ago. It's so _remote_ I didn't even see my teammates' faces for almost half a year. The most surprising thing I experienced at the new job vs the previous one:

* I felt I have more connection to other teammates than in my previous non-remote job
* I had way more insight into what's happening in other projects in the company

Now most of us need to work remotely. I guess not all are happy about that, partially because all that accidental interaction lost.

Here's how we've always dealt with that:

## Set up personal channels on Slack

Let's say your name is Dorothy. Now go on and create a channel named: `#dorothy`. Treat this channel as your own blog, which is just published internally in your company, with your teammates comments inlined. Post anything related to your life: going on a hike, read something interesting, buying a piece of hardware and needing help — post it and let others chime in. Good place for occasional photos, too.

## _Overcommunicate_

When working on a project, don't defer communication until you're stuck or until you achieve something noteworthy. Turn yourself into `--verbose` mode and keep actively communicating whatever you're doing to progress with your task at hand. The benefits are threefold:

1. You're helping yourself, because you're effectively rubber-duck debugging
2. You're helping your teammates to stay updated with your progress, without waiting for the daily standup
3. You're helping yourself, because if you're encountering a problem for which a teammate knows a quicker solution, he can just jump in.

<!-- Example: yarn -->

<!-- #bleach-tomw -->

## One-off  1-1 calls

We've shared a lot of content on why meetings are suboptimal in most situations. We mostly mean meetings that are large, compulsory and regularly scheduled.

But...

## Prefer public comms

This may blow your mind, but [83% messages on our Slack are sent to public channels](https://twitter.com/andrzejkrzywda/status/1352694180326289412), only 17% in DMs. This is completely different from most other companies, percentage of public messages can even be a single digit.

Our dedication to communication via public channels helps many things. It's so much easier to be a part of a project you're not directly assigned to. 

## Voice channels on discord

This is a recent experiment we're running. We have a voice channel on discord where you can join and stay for a longer time, preferrably with Push-To-Talk enabled not to keep transmitting the whole time. Over time other teammates can join/leave with random interactions happening.
