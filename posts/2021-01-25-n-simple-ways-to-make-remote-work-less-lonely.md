# N simple ways to make remote work less lonely

Arkency is a remote-first company. I joined it 4+ years ago. What was most surprising for me:

* I felt I have more connection to other teammates than in my previous non-remote job
* I had way more insight into what's happening in other projects in the company

Now most of us need to work remotely. I guess not all are happy about that, partially because all that accidental interaction lost.

Here's how we've always dealt with that:

## Set up personal channels on Slack

Think of it like a blog. Personal stuff.

## Overcommunicate

Example: yarn

## One-off  1-1 calls

## Prefer public comms

Andrzej's twitter link

## Voice channels on discord
