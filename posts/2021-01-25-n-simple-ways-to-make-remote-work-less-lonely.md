# N simple ways to make remote work less lonely

I joined Arkency, a remote-first company, 4+ years ago. It was so _remote_ I didn't even see my teammates' faces for almost half a year. The most surprising thing I experienced at the new job, was that even it was remote:

* I felt I have more connection to other teammates than in my previous non-remote job
* I had way more insight into what's happening in other projects in the company

Nowadays most of us need to work remotely. I guess not everyone is happy about that, partially because of all that accidental human interaction lost.

Here's how we've always dealt with that:

## Set up personal channels on Slack

Let's say your name is Dorothy. Now create a channel named: `#dorothy`. Treat this channel as your own blog, which is just published internally in your company, with your teammates comments inlined. Post anything related to your life: going on a hike, read something interesting, buying a piece of hardware and needing help — post it and let others chime in. Good place for occasional photos, too.

## _Overcommunicate_

When working on a project, don't defer communication until you're stuck or until you achieve something noteworthy. Turn yourself into `--verbose` mode and keep actively communicating whatever you're doing to progress with your task at hand. The benefits are threefold:

1. You're helping yourself, because you're effectively rubber-duck debugging
2. You're helping your teammates to stay updated with your progress, without waiting for the daily standup
3. You're helping yourself, because if you're encountering a problem for which a teammate knows a quicker solution, he can just jump in.

Example: one day I had too set up assets compilation on CI. I would probably do it sooner or later with more or less googling and that was the plan. I just kept communicating what I'm doing step on a channel where everyone has access, but I didn't expect anyone to read. I didn't even assume anyone is around. By default I'm just communicating my moves for the purpose of rubber-duck-debugging. But perhaps someone is around, has already dealt with that and doesn't mind being interrupted at the moment — in such situation they can offer to help and this is what happened in this particular situation and I probably saved an hour or two. It wouldn't happen though, if I weren't _overcommunicating_, i.e. turn myself into `--verbose` mode. The default was just to keep doing it myself and noone would be offended if there wasn't any response to my messages.

## One-off  1-1 calls

We've shared a lot of content on why meetings are suboptimal in most situations. We mostly mean meetings that are large, compulsory and regularly scheduled.

But...

## Prefer public comms

This may blow your mind, but [83% messages on our Slack are sent to public channels](https://twitter.com/andrzejkrzywda/status/1352694180326289412), only 17% in DMs. This is completely different from most other companies, where percentage of public messages can even be a single digit.

Our dedication to communication via public channels helps many things. It's so much easier to be a part of a project you're not directly assigned to. 

## Voice channels on discord

This is a recent experiment we're running. We have a voice channel on discord where you can join and stay for a longer time, preferrably with Push-To-Talk enabled not to keep transmitting the whole time. Over time other teammates can join/leave with random interactions happening.
