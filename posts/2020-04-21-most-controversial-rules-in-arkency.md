1. Don't comment the code.
0. Don't use branches. Commit to master.
0. Let developers manage the project.
0. No refactoring sprints. Always refactor.
0. Don't send private messages. Use channels.
0. Don't @mention anyone unless it's really worth it.
0. Estimations are often a waste of time, energy and trust.
0. Meetings are often a waste of time, energy and momentum. Especially true if they're large, compulsory, regularly scheduled or not focused.
0. Got an idea? Ship it and prove it instead of asking for a blessing. Expect someone's _revert of indignation_ in worst case (a.k.a. _better to ask for forgiveness than permission_).
0. Proactively and continually communicate your progress instead of only asking questions when stuck (a.k.a. _tell, don't ask_).
0. Avoid communication proxies.
0. Share communication with the whole team.
0. Share accesses with the whole team. Everyone should be able to do anything instead of asking others.
0. Best story size is 1.
0. There should be one backlog.
0. Don't attach certain people to certain types of tasks. Always pick the first task from the top of a prioritized backlog.
0. Don't expect anyone to read/respond to your message immediately.
0. Avoid blocking (other people to wait on you - or - yourself to wait on others)

These rules are also:
* key reasons why people love to work _in_ Arkency
* key reasons why people love to work _with_ Arkency
* key ingredients that facilitate remote & async work 

Do you find any of these _rules_ particularly exciting, outraging or confusing? Let us know via twitter or email. We appreciate your input.

Of course most of these rules have their own:
* rationale 
* assumptions (e.g. we're a small, cohesive team of experienced & responsible engineers)
* exceptions (e.g. our internal weekly call is large and regular and unfocused - but it's voluntary and everyone loves it)
* alternatives (i.e. what do we do instead, e.g. record & summarize meetings to let others skip them and remain on the same page)
* costs (which we still choose to pay)

We'd like to **elaborate** on these points in coming blogposts. If you wanna stay in the loop [subscribe to our newsletter](https://arkency.com/newsletter/). We believe these guidelines are very valuable and we'd like our prospective clients and teammates to be aware of the way we prefer to work. 

We already covered most of these topics in [The Book](https://arkency.dpdcart.com/product/71091) or in our [26 other blogposts about async/remote](https://blog.arkency.com/tags/async-remote/).
