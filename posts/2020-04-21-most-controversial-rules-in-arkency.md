Also: top reasons why people love to work with us.

TODO: perhaps too ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥- not sure whether to eventually publish, but I wanna write it up somewhere.

1. Don't comment the code.
2. Don't use branches, commit to master.
3. PMs don't always help. Let developers take on this role.
4. Don't do refactoring sprints. Always refactor.
5. Tell don't ask.
6. Don't send private messages. Use channels.
7. Don't mention unless someone's attention really needed.
8. Don't `@here`.
9. Don't estimate.
10. Meetings are a huge waste of time in most cases.
11. Avoid communication proxies.
12. Share communication/knowledge/accesses as broadly as possible.
13. Best story size is one.
14. Single backlog.
15. Always pick the first task from the top of the backlog.

Maybe:
- You're responsible.
- More on meetings: Meetings are a waste of time especially if they're regularly scheduled status updates, compulsory, or more than 2 attendees. Ad hoc, voluntary meetings with clear goal are cool. Recording, sharing & summarizing meetings is great.
