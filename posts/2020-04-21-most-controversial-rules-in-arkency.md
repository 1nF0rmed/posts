Also: top reasons why people love to work with us.

TODO: perhaps too ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥- not sure whether to eventually publish, but I wanna write it up somewhere.
These rules are also the reasons why people love to work for us and with us.

1. Don't comment the code.
0. Don't use branches, commit to master.
0. Let developers manage the project.
0. No refactoring sprints. Always refactor.
0. Don't send private messages. Use channels.
0. Don't @mention unless it's really needed.
0. Estimations are a waste of time, energy and trust.
0. Meetings are often a waste of time (especially if large, compulsory & regularly scheduled).
0. Tell don't ask.
0. Avoid communication proxies.
0. Share communication/knowledge/accesses should be open to the whole team.
0. Best story size is 1.
0. Single backlog.
0. Always pick the first task from the top of the backlog.
0. Always record meetings so that others can catch-up async if they want to.

maybe
0. Don't @here
0. Avoid blocking. Questions can be a form of blocking.
0. Better to ask for forgiveness than for permission.
0. Do it yourself

Maybe:
- You're responsible.
- More on meetings: Meetings are a waste of time especially if they're regularly scheduled status updates, compulsory, or more than 2 attendees. Ad hoc, voluntary meetings with clear goal are cool. Recording, sharing & summarizing meetings is great.
