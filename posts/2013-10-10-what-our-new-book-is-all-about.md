At first, we tought that our [new book](http://sbx.sk/Ak8L) is all about remote
work. But then after writing few chapters we saw that it is not. That those
techniques can be applied to any team. So what is it all about?

## Happiness

To be more specific programmers happiness. This kind of happiness related to
working in a nicely organized project.

Do you feel happy in your current project? Or is it draining energy from you?
Do you feel trusted and enjoy tremendous freedom? Or do you rather feel
micro-managed? Do you experience progress in your skills? Or did they stuck
on certain level and you are using the same knowledge over and over again?
Are you learning new technologies, or still working with the same tools that
you already mastered? Do you feel like your team is a small community of
people, supportive and interested in each other? Or do you feel isolated and
the everyone is working on different, unrelated parts? Are you ok with your
working enviornment? Or is not enough adopted to your style of work, your
preferences. Maybe a bit too loud? Do you like what you devliver every day
for your customer, or it seems that nothing is ever fully finished?

What if you could improve many areas of your current project managment
that has a direct effect on you and your team happiness. What if you could
start a day at your own convinient time. And immedietally you could know
what you should be working on. What if the tasks that you work on are
small so that you deliver something valuable every day, or even twice a day
and be produt of that.
What if you could organize your time according to your liking and priorities?
Take your time in the middle of the day to create a meal compatible with
your diet. Excersise or walk to refresh your mind. Or take a lovely nap.
What if tasks in unfamiliar technology are learning opportunities and
small challenges and instead of being scary, long monsters. Can you imagine
your team collaborating together on the whole code instead of working
on fenced parts.

Our ebook is for you if you value Independence, Clarity, Focus, Freedom and Collboration.
It contains a list of guidelines that we established at Arkency throughout years
of working remotely. You can apply them to your project slowly and every
one of them will help you improve some of the aspects. Together they make
a tremendous difference and let you enjoy lot of the benefits that a
programmer job can offer. They create a programmer friendly environment in
which you can feel comfortable and productive. After all, most of your team
consist of programmers, so the project should be optimized for their
efficiency and happiness. But it also creates a nice set of rules that make the customers
and product owners communication with developers easier.

As programmers we are privilaged. In our lifes we can enjoy many things that
people doing other kinds of job cannot. But we need a workflow that will let
us actually seize the opprotunities such as eg. the ability to work remotely.

As team leaders and company owners we always want to hire and work with 
the best people. But they also have very high expectations. Is your company
ready to provide them a nicely working experience to benefit most from their
talent and experience?
