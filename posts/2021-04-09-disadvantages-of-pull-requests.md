actually — pull requests and reviews

yes, sometimes unavoidable, but do you know all the costs?

it takes the same focus

less responsibility

doesn't promote action

short feedback look is what makes programming fun

10 KLOC PR - LGTM, or nitpicks random issues
10 LOC PR — finds 10 bugs

discourages continuous refactoring

promotes long living branches
