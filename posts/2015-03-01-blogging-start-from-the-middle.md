Time constraints seems to be the main reason for not blogging more often. 

Today, I’d like to teach you a technique which reverses the situation - the blog post is created in your available time.

<!-- more -->

I call this technique - “**start from the middle**”. The point is to start your post with the main message. Find the MVP of your blog post. 

What’s the minimal content to write and still get the message through? 

What’s the minimal thing you need to write to help your readers in the chosen topic?

Sometimes, it may be just 3-4 sentences. Sometimes it’s a picture with a short explanation. It can also be a piece of code. It can be just a list of points. 

The point is to make it consistent and **shippable**. If I run out of time, I want to ship (publish) the post and still deliver value. It doesn’t need to be perfect. It probably won’t be. 

This approach is not about being perfect. If you’re a perfectionists, you may have hard time applying it in practice.

Does it sound similar to what you’ve done before? The agile approach to coding is very similar. Release early, release often. Start with something minimal which works and then iteratively improve it.
