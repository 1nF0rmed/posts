Recently in our project, we came up with a list of non-coding activities. Those are the tasks that need be done quite regularly and might be easy to be forgotten.

<!-- more -->

If we tend to forget them, then there's a risk that someone else will introduce a process around those activities. Sometimes it may mean new people will be brought so that they "manage" those activities. In my opinion, the more can be done by a developer the better, because we don't introduce non-technical people to the communication loop.

* read communication on pivotal (and optionally reply)
* read communication on slack (and optionally reply)
* build/monitoring failures
* review commits from others
* work on our tickets
* look at exception notifications
* create new tickets based on build failures or exceptions
* challenge the prios in backlog
* check security updates for gems
* document higher level concepts (architecture, tracking, technical debt)
* remove dead code, unused feature toggles

I will probably keep updating this list, as this may serve our team in the longer run. If you feel that we miss something important here, feel free to comment, thanks!
