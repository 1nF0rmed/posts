# 10x Developer Destructured

<!-- AKA 10x Developer Dissected -->
<!-- AKA Constituents of a 10x Developer -->

Everyone has heard of mythical _10x developers_. Do they exist? Recruiters want to hire them. Developers mostly think it's not them. But:

10x = x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x

Are all the `x`'s about coding? What makes someone averagely 10x efficient at work? Here are some of my ideas:

**TODO: it's just a brain dump so far, need to adjust according to actual relevance.**

## Communication

## Being kind

## Not taking offense

## Timeless programming knowledge

We had a blogpost about that...

## Architectural patters

## Mental models

## Actual programming

## Command line Fu
