As a consulting agency we are often asked to help with projects which embrace
lots of typical Rails conventions. One of the most common of them is the usage
of STI (Single Table Inheritance). It is even considered [best practice by some
people for some usecases](http://rails-bestpractices.com/posts/45-use-sti-and-polymorphic-model-for-multiple-uploads)
[YMMV]. I would like to show some typical problems related to STI usage and
propose different solutions and perhaps workarounds.

## Story

It is very common for US-related projects to store customer billing and
shipping address (_something I am completely unable to grasp as
a concept_). In Poland, you might have multiple addresses also such as
registered address, home address, mailing address, etc (_I do not expect
you to grasp this concept as a foreigner also, i guess each country
has its own quirks_). So I will use address as an example. Although I have
mostly seen STI usage for different kind of notifications and for events
(such as meeting, concert, movie, etc).

## Starting point

Let's say that your user can have multiple addresses.

```
#!ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :addresses
end

class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
end

class BillingAddress < Address
end

class ShippingAddress < Address
end
```

In the beggining everything always works. Things get complicated with time
when you start adding new features. Obviously we are missing some validation.
For whatever reason, let's assume that they need to differ between types. In
our example `ShippingAddress` we would like to restrict number of countries.

```
#!ruby
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :full_name, :city, :street, :postal_code
end

class BillingAddress < Address
  validates_presence_of :country
end

class ShippingAddress < Address
  validates_inclusion_of :country, in: %w(USA Canada)
end
```

Of course, this is trivial example, and probably nobody would write it this
way. But it will suit our needs and I have seen similar code in many reviewed projects.

```
#!ruby
u = User.new(login: "rupert")
u.save!
a = u.addresses.build(type: "BillingAddress", full_name: "Robert Pankowecki", city: "Wrocław", country: "Poland")
a.save!
```

This code is possible 
[in Rails 4 where building association with STI type was fixed](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/89b5b31cc4f8407f648a2447665ef23f9024e8a5). 
[When using Rails 3 you will have to use workaround discussed in next paragraph also when creating
new record](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15264680/how-to-build-activerecord-associations-with-sti).

## Type Change

STI is problematic when there is possibility of type change. And usually
there is. Frontend is displaying some kind of form and is responsible for
toggling visible fields depending on selected type of object and user can
update object type. Very useful in case of user mistakes.

Let's see the problem in action:

```
#!ruby
a.update(type: "ShippingAddress", country: "Spain")
a.class.name # => "BillingAddress"
a.valid? # => true
a.reload # => ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find BillingAddress with id=1 [WHERE "addresses"."type" IN ('BillingAddress')]
```

The problem is that we cannot change object class in runtime. This problem is not
typical for ruby, many object oriented programming languages suffer from it.
And when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense.

I think this tells us something about inheritance in general. It is very
powerful mechanizm but you should avoid it when there is possibility of type
or behavior change. And favour other solutions such as delegation, strategy
or roles. Whenever I want to use inheritance I ask
myself _is it possible that such statement will no longer be truthful_ ?
If it is, avoid inheritance. 

Example: `Admin < User`. Is it possible that my
`User` will no longer be an `Admin`. Yes! Ah, so being admin is more likely
a role that you have in organization. Inheritance won't do.

In fact I think there is very little place for inheritance when modeling real
world. Whenever your object changes properties at runtime and its behaviour must
also change because of such fact, you will be better with delegation and
strategy. But, there are areas of code when I never had problem with inheritance
such as [GUI components](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.button.aspx).

## Workaround

The workaround requires fixing Rails in two places. First the `update_record` method
must execute the query without restricting SQL update to the type of object
because we want to change it.

We also need a second method (`metamorphose`) that heavily relies on
little known [`ActiveRecord#becomes`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-becomes)
method which [deals with copying all the Active Record variables from one object to another](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7d122b5f27a5f7872a314a05b41fc9fefa584127/activerecord/lib/active_record/persistence.rb#L183).

There are two potential problems here:

* virtual attributes are not copied, rails does not know about them, and
chances are you are not storing them in `@attributes` instance variable
* as you can see in the monkey patching code (for rails 3.2) we are using `connection` from
a `base_class` class. This usually does not matter as most project use the same
connection for all `ActiveRecord` classes. It is hard to say which class'
connection should be used when changing the object type from one to another.

```
#!ruby
module ActiveRecord
  module StiFriendly
    # Rails 3.2
    def update(attribute_names = @attributes.keys)
      attributes_with_values = arel_attributes_values(false, false, attribute_names)
      return 0 if attributes_with_values.empty?
      klass = self.class.base_class # base_class added
      stmt  = klass.unscoped.where(klass.arel_table[klass.primary_key].eq(id)).arel.compile_update(attributes_with_values)
      klass.connection.update stmt
    end

    # Rails 4.0
    def update_record(attribute_names = @attributes.keys)
      attributes_with_values = arel_attributes_with_values_for_update(attribute_names)
      if attributes_with_values.empty?
        0
      else
        klass = self.class
        column_hash = klass.connection.schema_cache.columns_hash klass.table_name
        db_columns_with_values = attributes_with_values.map { |attr,value|
          real_column = column_hash[attr.name]
          [real_column, value]
        }
        bind_attrs = attributes_with_values.dup
        bind_attrs.keys.each_with_index do |column, i|
          real_column = db_columns_with_values[i].first
          bind_attrs[column] = klass.connection.substitute_at(real_column, i)
        end
        # base_class added
        stmt = klass.base_class.unscoped.where(klass.arel_table[klass.primary_key].eq(id_was || id)).arel.compile_update(bind_attrs)
        klass.connection.update stmt, 'SQL', db_columns_with_values
      end
    end

    def metamorphose(klass)
      obj      = becomes(klass)
      obj.type = klass.name
      return obj
    end
  end
end

class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveRecord::StiFriendly
end

u = User.last
a = u.addresses.last
a = a.metamorphose(ShippingAddress)
a.update_attributes(full_name: "RP") # => false

# Validation worked properly
a.errors => #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x0000000352f0f0 @base=#<BillingAddress id: 1, country: "Poland", city: "Wrocław", user_id: 3, created_at: "2013-07-27 17:16:26", updated_at: "2013-07-27 17:16:46", type: "ShippingAddress", full_name: "RP">, @messages={:country=>["is not included in the list"]}

# Yay!
a.update_attributes(full_name: "RP", country: "USA") # => true
a.reload # => ShippingAddress
```

Would I recommend using such hack in production? Hell no! You can see in the
output that there is something wrong and check it easily:

```
#!ruby
a.errors => #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x0000000352f0f0 @base=#<BillingAddress id: 1, country: "Poland", city: "Wrocław", user_id: 3, created_at: "2013-07-27 17:16:26", updated_at: "2013-07-27 17:16:46", type: "ShippingAddress", full_name: "RP">, @messages={:country=>["is not included in the list"]}
a.errors.instance_variable_get(:@base).object_id == a.object_id # => false
```

When going such route, I would probably create a new record with `#metamorphose`,
save it, and destroy the old record if saving succeeded. All in transaction,
obviously. But this might be even harder when there are lot of associations
that would also require fixing foreign key. Maybe destroying old record first, and
creating a new one with same id (instead of relaying on auto increment)
is some kind of solution? What do you think?

But finding workarounds for such Rails problems is a good excersie. Mostly through
such debugging and looking at Rails internals I got better in understanding
it and its limitations. I no longer believe that throwing more and more logic
into AR classes is a good solution. And the more you throw (STI,
state_machine, IdentityMap, attachments), the more likely you will experience
corner cases and troubles with migrations to new Rails version.

Ok, now that we know the solution that we don't like, let's look into something
more favourable.
