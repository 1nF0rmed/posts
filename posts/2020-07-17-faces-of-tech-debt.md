Most IT projects fail. Reasons are many, but tech debt is one of them. Tech debt has many faces. Know your enemy.

## Spaghetti code

## Coupling everywhere

## Implicit side effects

## Global state

## Too many dependencies

## Long-overdue upgrades

## No tests

## Tests running a loooong time

## Failing tests

## Tests difficult to modify

## No CI/CD
