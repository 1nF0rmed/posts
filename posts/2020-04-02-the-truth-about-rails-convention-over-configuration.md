This blogpost is a work in progress. It's also a call for collaboration to Arkency friends (via pull requests) if the goal of this blogpost resonates with you.

The goal of this post is to:

* show definition of the word "convention"
* remind what configuration meant before Rails appeared (maybe examples from Struts XML?)
* provide as many examples of Rails conventions as possible
* summarize/group those conventions - it's likely that many of those are just metaprogramming or "magic"
* explain why those conventions optimize for the first N days of developing the Rails app
* explain, provide examples - how some of the conventions introduce coupling at the design level
* conclude that Rails Convention over Configuration may lead and often leads to technical debt
* explain ideas behind Architecture over Convention
* provide alternative solutions to the listed Rails conventions - link to other blogposts/resources, including Arkency ones, but not limited to them

Once the goals are accomplished, this blogpost will be published, linked from Arkency blog index and linked from the sitemap. Before it happens, it has its own URL which you can send to other potential collaborators - [https://blog.arkency.com/the-truth-about-rails-convention-over-configuration](https://blog.arkency.com/the-truth-about-rails-convention-over-configuration)
